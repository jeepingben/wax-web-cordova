# wax-web-cordova
Android port of the wax-web project using cordova

While porting this, it diverged enough from wax-web that it should be a separate repo instead of a branch.  This behaves like the wax-web project, but includes a social sharing button to share wax recommendations via SMS/Email/etc.
